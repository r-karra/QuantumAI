# Understanding the Quantum State |ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2

> Based on material from [quantum.country](https://quantum.country)

This document explains the state, its vector form, measurement behavior, and Bloch-sphere interpretation.

---

## 1. Writing the State in Vector Form

The computational basis states are:

```
|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ
|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ
```

So the given state becomes:

```
|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ
```

This is the **component (column vector) notation** for the state.

---

## 2. Intuitive Meaning

The factor `i` (representing a 90° phase shift) means that the two parts of the superposition — |0⟩ and |1⟩ — are **out of phase**.

On the **Bloch sphere**:
- `|0⟩` is at the north pole.
- `|1⟩` is at the south pole.
- `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2` lies on the **+X axis**.
- Our state `( |0⟩ + i|1⟩ ) / √2` lies on the **+Y axis**.

So this state is rotated by **90° about the Z-axis** compared to `|+⟩`.

We usually call this state:

```
|y+⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2
```

---

## 3. Measurement Outcomes

### In the Z-basis (|0⟩, |1⟩)

```
p(0) = |⟨0|ψ⟩|² = 1/2
p(1) = |⟨1|ψ⟩|² = 1/2
```

So measuring in the computational (Z) basis gives equal probabilities for `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.

---

### In the Y-basis (|y+⟩, |y−⟩)

Define:

```
|y+⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2
|y−⟩ = (|0⟩ − i|1⟩)/√2
```

Since `|ψ⟩ = |y+⟩`, measurement results are deterministic:

```
p(y+) = 1
p(y−) = 0
```

So the qubit is **fully aligned with the +Y direction**.

---

## 4. Density Matrix Form

The density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is:

```
ρ = (1/2) * [[1, -i],
              [i,  1]]
```

---

## 5. Pauli Operator Expectations

Using the Pauli matrices:

```
σx = [[0, 1],
      [1, 0]]

σy = [[0, -i],
      [i,  0]]

σz = [[1,  0],
      [0, -1]]
```

The expectation values are:

```
⟨σx⟩ = 0
⟨σy⟩ = +1
⟨σz⟩ = 0
```

So the Bloch vector for this state is:

```
r = (0, 1, 0)
```

which confirms it lies on the **+Y axis**.

---

## 6. Projector Representation

Projectors for Y-basis measurement:

```
Π(y+) = (1/2) * [[1, -i],
                 [i,  1]]

Π(y−) = (1/2) * [[1,  i],
                 [-i, 1]]
```

These satisfy:
```
Π(y+) + Π(y−) = I
Π(y+) − Π(y−) = σy
```

---

## 7. Circuit That Prepares This State

Start from `|0⟩` and apply:

1. **Hadamard (H)** gate:
   ```
   H|0⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2 = |+⟩
   ```

2. **Phase (S)** gate:
   ```
   S = diag(1, i)
   S|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 = |ψ⟩
   ```

Circuit notation:

```
|0⟩ ── H ── S ──▶ |ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2
```

## 8. Summary Table

| Property | Symbol / Formula | Result |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **State** | `|ψ⟩` | `( |0⟩ + i|1⟩ ) / √2` |
| **Vector form** | — | (1/√2) · [1, i]ᵀ |
| **Bloch vector** | — | (0, 1, 0) |
| **Axis on Bloch sphere** | — | +Y |
| **Z-basis measurement** | — | (½, ½) |
| **Y-basis measurement** | — | (1, 0) |
| **⟨σx⟩, ⟨σy⟩, ⟨σz⟩** | — | (0, 1, 0) |
| **Preparation circuit** | — | H → S |

---

## 9. Interpretation

This qubit state represents a **pure phase rotation** of `|+⟩`.  
It behaves identically to `|+⟩` when measured in Z or X bases,  
but yields a deterministic outcome when measured along the Y axis.  

This shows how a **relative phase** — even if invisible in one basis —  
corresponds to a **rotation on the Bloch sphere**, which *does* affect other measurements.

## why a superposition of quantum states is the same as a linear combination of quantum states?


# Why a Superposition of Quantum States Is the Same as a Linear Combination

This note explains why the *superposition principle* in quantum mechanics is mathematically equivalent to saying that quantum states form **linear combinations** in a Hilbert space.

---

## 1. The Essence of Quantum States: A Vector Space

Quantum states live in a **Hilbert space**, which is a kind of *vector space* (like the usual Euclidean space, but possibly infinite-dimensional and complex-valued).

In any vector space:

- You can **add** vectors.
- You can **multiply** them by numbers (called *scalars*).
- The result is still a valid vector in that space.

In quantum mechanics, this means:

```
If |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩ are possible states,
then |ψ⟩ = α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩
is also a valid quantum state (after normalization).
```

That’s the **superposition principle** — it’s not an extra rule, but simply the **vector space structure** of quantum theory.

---

## 2. The Origin of the Term “Superposition”

The term *superposition* comes from **wave physics** — such as light or sound — where two waves **add linearly** when they overlap.

Quantum mechanics uses **wavefunctions** (or state vectors) that satisfy a **linear equation** — the Schrödinger equation.

Because the Schrödinger equation is *linear*, adding two valid solutions gives another valid solution. Hence, we say a quantum system can exist in a *superposition* of those states — which literally means *a linear combination* of wavefunctions.

---

## 3. The Meaning of Coefficients

In a general qubit state:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

the coefficients α and β are **complex probability amplitudes**.

Their squared magnitudes give the measurement probabilities:

```
P(0) = |α|²
P(1) = |β|²
```

These amplitudes can interfere with each other — a uniquely quantum effect that arises precisely because of the **linear** nature of the state space.

If the theory were nonlinear, interference would vanish — and quantum computing, chemistry, and much of physics would stop working.

---

## 4. Why They’re “the Same”

Because in a **Hilbert space**, “superposition” *is defined as* forming a new state by **linear combination**.

| Perspective | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Mathematical** | You’re taking a linear combination of basis vectors. |
| **Physical** | You’re superposing multiple possible quantum states, allowing interference. |

So:

> Superposition is the *physical interpretation* of the mathematical fact that quantum states form a linear vector space.

---

## 5. A Vivid Analogy

Think of a musical chord.

Each note (C, E, G) is like a **basis state**. When you play them together, you get a **superposition of sound waves** — and what your ear hears depends on their relative phases and amplitudes.

Quantum superposition is similar — except we’re adding **probability amplitudes**, not air-pressure waves.

---

## 6. One-Line Summary

> A “superposition” of quantum states is **physically** what happens when you **mathematically** take a linear combination of their state vectors — because quantum mechanics is built on a *linear vector space*.

---

### Optional Next Step

This linear structure comes directly from the **linearity of the Schrödinger equation**. Exploring that connection shows *why* superposition is baked into the dynamics of quantum mechanics.
